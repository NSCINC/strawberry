## ‚ú® Project Overview

**Strawberry** is an innovative platform developed by HoloFi, focusing on artificial intelligence and decentralized applications (DApps). Utilizing the latest technologies, Strawberry aims to deliver secure, efficient, and intelligent solutions for managing digital assets and executing smart contracts. Our mission is to redefine how digital interactions occur, ensuring users benefit from cutting-edge advancements in AI and blockchain technology.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have compilers for C and Java installed on your system.
- Install Node.js and npm for managing dependencies and running backend services.
- Set up Rubyx and Lua for scripting and automation tasks.
- Configure a Shell environment for executing scripts.
- Install Go for service development.
- Basic understanding of C, Java, Node.js, Shell, Rubyx, Lua, and Go is required.

## üöÄ Getting Started
